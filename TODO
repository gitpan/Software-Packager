Software::Packager
	Extend and improve the API and POD.

Software::Packager::Object
	This should be okay but I'd like to improve the mode method some what.
	At present you must pass an octal value or face the consequences.

Software::Packager::Tar
	creates tar files okay but if you do a tar -tvf on the archive it gives
	direcory checksum errors.
	Test script may need improving.
