DESCRIPTION
If you release software for a range of platforms then this is the module for
you.  Software::Packager is the base module for suite of Perl modules providing
a common interface for the creation of platform specific software installation
packagers.
From version 0.05 you also need to install the Software::Packager module for
the platform you require.

This module does not do the packaging of the software but is merely a wrapper
around the various software packaging tools already provided with various
operating systems.
